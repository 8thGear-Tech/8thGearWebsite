          You don't have to be an accountant to be able to do that; you can just
          have a notebook. I always advise non-accountants to just have a
          notebook. Practice the art of recording all your transactions: "I
          bought A and I sold B." With that, you're already an accountant, and
          tracking and reporting financial transactions are second nature to
          you.

        For a bank statement, I don't always recommend using USSD; instead, use
        a mobile app with a comment section where you can record the
        transaction's narrative. For instance, if you're inviting a third party
        to come and audit your books or you're outsourcing the accounting
        function to an outsider, they may not know that. Okay, maybe the
        transaction will say, "X amount of money was spent on Mr. X, Y, and Z."
        But, as a third party, I have no idea who Mr. X Y is if you know the
        narrative X Y Z for which I purchased tissue paper, groceries, or
        whatever. So it makes it easier for whoever is checking the books to
        know what exactly these expenses were incurred for

        The other source documents are all invoices and receipts. We may not be
        able to obtain every detail for all of your transactions or receipts,
        despite our best efforts. But in most cases, we always encourage
        everybody, or the taxpayer, to make sure that they get all your invoices

        Entrepreneurs should have schedules that can also provide information to
        whoever is going to help prepare the accounts. Your salary, schedule,
        rent, shares, payroll, and fixed assets—you need to have all of those
        forms, and the accountant can assist you on how to do the deposition and
        all the provisions. All we have done is sort of put all this information
        together with our report. This brings us back to the essence of what we
        need to analyze properly.

        When it comes to sales and credit sales, make sure that any credit you
        extend is within reasonable limits. Also, if you're fortunate enough to
        be able to get into those with whom you're doing business and they're
        willing to extend credit to you, make sure that the credit days they
        extend to you are far greater than the credit days you extend to your
        customers.

          Prior to the enactment of the startup bill, people simply decided to
          build innovative products and looked for what registration fit them,

        But the initial years are difficult, and that is why you need an
        enabling law that will help give you some semblance of support. The
        ecosystem partners came together to say, "Look, we need some level of
        support from the States, some level of guidance, some level of
        enablement. And the government said, "Okay, what do you need? Let's come
        together; let's make a law that will now enable you so that the Startup

        The agreed-upon definition of a "startup" includes businesses that are
        starting up that are leveraging technology and providing innovative
        growth-based services. Startups largely refer to tech-driven businesses.
        If you are going to start any business, leverage technology. The world
        has gone beyond analog; everything is digitalized. And even as backward
        as we may think we are, we have gone far. Let us take, for instance, the
        blue rail line in Lagos. So technology is taking over the entire world.
        Technology is a train. It will come to you if you don't enter; it will
        crush you.
